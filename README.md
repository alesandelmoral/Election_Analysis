## Business proposal 

This code could be very useful for any kind of election, for example:

1. With some modifications we can use this code for a biggest elections, like president elections for a country.
2. Otherwise we can use this code for public consultations about public politics, with the diferent that in this type of code insted of having candidates we will have proposals.
3. Even we can use this code for a marketing analysis in which we want to know for example the preference of a brand, and base on the reasults make and strategy to sell.
